        <h2>What's it like to be awake when the rest of your world is 
          asleep?</h2>
        <p>Meet early morning joggers, a lonely short-wave radio DJ, a modern 
        Romeo and Juliet, the writer of a most unusual letter, and numerous 
        others.</p>
        <p>Through a series of songs, scenes and monologues, they'll survive 
        lonely nights and sleepovers, discover whether the Monster Under the 
        Bed is real and maybe even get to answer that all-important question: 
        <em>"Is anybody out there?"</em></p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Running Time:</strong> 30-35 minutes</li>
          <li><strong>Cast Breakdown:</strong> 3 males, 3 females (with 
            multiple casting) for professional productions or others seeking a 
            small cast.  For high schools, youth theatres, colleges or other 
            groups interested in a larger ensemble, the cast size can easily be 
            as large as 30 or more by having each actor play only one role and 
            by taking advantage of the opportunities that exist in the script 
            to use an ensemble.  All roles are meant to be played by teens, or 
            actors capable of playing teens.</li>
          <li><strong>Technical and Musical Requirements:</strong> The show 
            requires very set or other technical elements.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Best Suited for professional and amateur theatre companies, high 
        schools, youth theatres and colleges. Given its length 4 A.M. is ideal 
        for one-act competitions and has met with considerable success in this 
        arena.</p>
